### Build a Soccer League

This app will take a CSV file titled `soccer_players.csv` and assign
players to a team based on their experience.

Allowing each team to have an even number of experienced players.

After that is done, it will create a new file titled `teams.txt`,
which will include all of the players and the team they were assigned to.

And because I am going for extra credit:

Lastly, it will create `18` welcome letters, one for each player, letting
their parents know when the next practice is (My birthday, duh).
